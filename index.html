            <h2>Ramen Noodles</h2>
            <p>
                As well as a distinctive broth, noodles are a very important part of ramen. They add flavour and substance to the dish and play just as big a part as the other ingredients included.

            <p>
                Ramen noodles tend to be made with Lye water (potassium carbonate solution), which gives them the yellow colour that is often associated with ramen, it also helps to give them a good texture to avoid getting lost in the broth. Ramen noodles can come in all shapes and sizes and some regions of Japan will serve straight noodles, some serve curly noodles, it can be down to where you are.
